# Applies the per-tier opencode models from factory.yaml to opencode.json and
# the .opencode/agent/*.md role files, so reconfiguring is one factory.yaml
# edit plus `make sync-harnesses` — the same flow as Claude and Codex.
#
# It writes the top-level model (default tier), small_model (economy tier), and
# each agent's model (by role tier). The COST_PROFILE collapse is applied here,
# at sync time, so flipping the profile in factory.yaml and re-syncing works.
#
# In the template repo these keys are unset, so OPENCODE_*_MODEL stay unset
# and this script leaves opencode.json / the role files untouched — the committed
# placeholders stay put and the drift check stays clean.
