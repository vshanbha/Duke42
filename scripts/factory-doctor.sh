# scripts/factory-doctor.sh (Decision 14)
# Health report for an installed software factory. Answers the question an
# adopter actually has: "are the gates live in my repo, or just installed?"
#
# It classifies every gate as armed / inert / stale from factory.yaml, checks
# that the hook scripts and generated adapters are intact, checks that the
# protected paths are covered by CODEOWNERS, and finally runs the break/fix
# self-test so you watch each gate fire. Honest by construction: a gate you
# have not armed is reported inert, not hidden.
#
# Exit 0 = healthy (inert gates are a choice, not a failure).
# Exit 1 = something is broken: a missing/unexecutable hook, adapter drift, or
#          a failing break/fix proof.
