# model tokens), one clearly-labeled estimate, and a pointer to where measured
# token spend actually lives (the harness). It never prints a "tokens saved"
# headline — that is a counterfactual it cannot measure. See docs/COST_AND_TOKENS.md.

# Usage: factory report            # print the report
#        factory report --clear    # reset the gate-block event log
