#
# factory.yaml is a deliberately constrained format so this parser stays tiny:
#   - flat `key: value` pairs, one per line, no nesting
#   - lists are space-separated values on one line
#   - values may be double-quoted; a trailing ` # comment` is stripped
# Anything more expressive belongs in a hook, not in configuration.
#
# Usage (from a hook, after sourcing this file):
#   value="$(factory_config_get test_file_patterns)"
#   value="$(factory_config_get check_command 'make check')"   # with default
#
# FACTORY_CONFIG overrides the config path (used by the break/fix self-tests).

# factory_config_export: load the settings scripts need as shell variables.
#
# These used to live in factory.config, which was *sourced* — configuration an
# adopter edits, executed by every script that read it. They are now ordinary
# factory.yaml keys, parsed like everything else (Decision 41). One file, read
# and never run.
#
# Each variable is only set when the YAML defines it, so anything already in the
# environment still wins — that is what lets a caller override a model tier for
# one run. Repositories that predate the move keep working: factory.config is
# sourced first when it exists, and the YAML overlays whatever it defines. That
# fallback is deliberately quiet here; `factory doctor` is where it is reported,
# so a deprecation cannot live forever by going unnoticed.
# factory_config_load_legacy <file>: export the settings a pre-YAML factory.config
# defines, by PARSING it — never by sourcing it.
#
# Sourcing was the original implementation and it undid the property the move to
# factory.yaml exists to provide. factory.config lives in the repository, so it
# can arrive from a branch, a patch or a pull request; sourcing it executed
# whatever it contained, with the privileges of whatever called this — including
# CI. `factory migrate-config` already parsed the same file for exactly this
# reason ("parsing it beats sourcing it"), so this only makes the library agree
# with the tool that replaces it.
#
# Same grammar as that parser: KEY=value, optional single or double quotes, a
# trailing ` #` comment on unquoted values only, and keys restricted to shell
# identifiers. Only the fixed key list below is exported, so an unexpected name
# in the file cannot set an arbitrary variable.
# The settings the factory recognises. Both the YAML and the legacy reader are
# restricted to this list, so neither file can set a variable the factory did
# not ask for.
