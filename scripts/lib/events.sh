# block that a deterministic hook made), for `factory report`. Writes one
# tab-separated line to the event log — $FACTORY_EVENT_LOG if set, else
# .factory/events.log at the repo root.
#
# It must never fail a hook: a hook's job is enforcement, not bookkeeping, so
# every error here is swallowed and the function always returns 0. If the repo
# root can't be resolved (not a git checkout), it quietly does nothing.
