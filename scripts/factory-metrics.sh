# scripts/factory-metrics.sh
# What the factory is actually doing to this repository.
#
# Local only. Nothing is transmitted, and nothing here changes that: the factory
# you install never phones home. These numbers are computed on your machine, from
# your repository, for you — export them yourself if you want them elsewhere.
#
# Usage:
#   factory metrics                 # terminal report
#   factory metrics --json          # machine-readable, for your own collector
#   factory metrics --html          # writes .factory/metrics.html and opens it
#   factory metrics --html --no-open # writes it without opening a browser
#   factory metrics --days 90       # window (default 30)
#
# Two rules govern what appears here:
#   1. Every metric names the decision it informs. A number nobody acts on is
#      noise wearing a lab coat.
#   2. The uncomfortable ones are shown first-class — gates you route around,
#      gates that are inert, baselines that are stale. A report that only shows
#      wins is marketing, not measurement.
#
# Most of this is derived from git history, so it is meaningful the day you
# install the factory rather than after months of collecting events.
