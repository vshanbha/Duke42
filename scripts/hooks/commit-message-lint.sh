# scripts/hooks/commit-message-lint.sh
# Computational enforcement of commit message conventions.
#
# Two concerns:
#   1. Conventional commits + length discipline
#      - subject: <type>(<scope>)?: <description>
#        types: feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|test|ci|build|perf
#      - subject: no trailing period
#      - body: max 6 bullets, each bullet <= 25 words
#   2. The Verification Contract (docs/FACTORY_RULES.md,
#      memory/lessons/001-verification-contract.md)
#      - no "verified"/"fixed"/"works" claim without command + output citation
#      - "written but NOT verified" is always acceptable
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/hooks/commit-message-lint.sh <sha>   # check one commit
#   ./scripts/hooks/commit-message-lint.sh         # read one message from stdin
#   CI: for sha in $(git rev-list BASE..HEAD); do
#         ./scripts/hooks/commit-message-lint.sh "$sha"
#       done
#
# Merge and revert commits are exempt from the conventional-commits subject check.
# Bracket expressions ([[:space:]]) and [(] [)] are used instead of backslash
# escapes so the patterns are portable across GNU and BSD ERE (CI on Linux,
# local dev on macOS).

# Read the commit message
if [ -n "${1:-}" ]; then
  MESSAGE=$(git log --format=%B -1 "$1")

  if [ -t 0 ]; then
    echo "commit-message-lint: no sha argument and stdin is a terminal — pass a sha or pipe a message" >&2
