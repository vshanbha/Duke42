# Blocks push if memory/PENDING-LESSONS.md exists — the loop-close check
# wrote a reminder that was never addressed.
#
# The loop-close-check.sh (called by the dispose hook) writes
# memory/PENDING-LESSONS.md when files changed during a session but no
# corresponding lesson was written to memory/lessons/. This hook turns
# that nudge into push-time enforcement: the nudge is ignorable, the
# push block is not.
#
# Also checks for memory/.parity-stale (written by diff-aware-check.sh
# when factory-hooks.ts is modified — flags that the previous OBSERVED
# parity pass is stale and requires re-verification).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/hooks/pending-lessons-push-block.sh
#
# Exit 0 = no pending reminders — push allowed
# Exit 1 = pending reminder(s) exist — push blocked
