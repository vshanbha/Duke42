# scripts/hooks/decision-log-gate.sh
# Verifies that commits touching governance-sensitive paths reference a
# Decision number in the decision log.
#
# The rule this hook enforces (from AGENTS.md):
#   "Every decision goes in the decision log (or an ADR) before code, not after."
#
# This hook catches the failure where code is written that implements a
# decision, but the decision was never recorded in the decision log.
#
# Governance-sensitive paths (files that, if changed, likely implement a
# decision):
#   - protected_paths from factory.yaml (permanently human-reviewed)
#   - opencode.json           (canonical config)
#   - .opencode/              (agents, plugin, skills)
#   - .claude/                (Claude adapter)
#   - .codex/                 (Codex adapter)
#   - scripts/                (hooks, enforcement logic)
#   - docs/adr/               (ADR changes are themselves decisions)
#   - .github/CODEOWNERS      (governance)
#   - .github/workflows/      (CI is governance)
#   - Makefile                (build targets are governance)
#   - specs/                  (feature specs — canonical source)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/hooks/decision-log-gate.sh                # check working tree
#   ./scripts/hooks/decision-log-gate.sh <base> <head> # check base..head range
#
# Exit 0 = all governance-touching commits reference a Decision, or no governance paths changed
# Exit 1 = a governance-touching commit lacks a Decision reference
