# scripts/hooks/hook-existence-check.sh
# CI safety net for the fail-open decision in factory-hooks.ts.
#
# The plugin's catch block fails open: if a hook script is missing or
# unexecutable, edits are allowed with a log line. This is deliberate
# (fail-closed would halt the whole factory on a missing file, including
# test-writing by the spec-writer). But the fail-open path must never
# persist silently across a merge.
#
# This check verifies that every hook script referenced by the plugin and
# CI exists and is executable. If a script is missing or not executable,
# this check fails — catching the fail-open condition before it ships.
#
# Your own hooks belong in factory.yaml, not in this list. This file is a
# framework file: `factory upgrade` overwrites it byte-for-byte, so anything
# added here by hand is lost on the next upgrade. Register repo-local hooks with
#   local_hooks: "scripts/hooks/my-gate.sh scripts/hooks/other-gate.sh"
# An entry may also carry arguments — a token starting with `-` belongs to the
# hook before it, and pre-push-check runs the hook with them:
#   local_hooks: "scripts/hooks/my-gate.sh --strict scripts/hooks/other-gate.sh"
# and they are checked exactly like the shipped ones.
