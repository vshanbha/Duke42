# scripts/hooks/loop-close-check.sh
# Second-brain loop-close trigger (Karpathy pattern).
#
# Called by the opencode plugin's dispose hook at session end.
# Checks: did files change during this session without a corresponding
# lesson being written to memory/lessons/? If so, writes a reminder
# to memory/PENDING-LESSONS.md.
#
# This is a NUDGE, not enforcement. It cannot block session close
# (the opencode API has no session-close event; dispose is best-effort).
# The AGENTS.md "loop-close" rule is the agent-discipline backstop.
#
# Usage (called from factory-hooks.ts dispose hook):
#   FACTORY_SESSION_START_HEAD=<sha> ./scripts/hooks/loop-close-check.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no changes, or changes + lessons written (silent)
#   1 — changes made but no new lesson files (reminder written)
#
# factory: no-block-event — this gate's non-zero exit stops no work.
#
# `factory metrics` counts blocks: work a gate actually stopped. This one writes
# a reminder and the opencode dispose hook cannot block session close, so
# logging its exit 1 would inflate the enforcement numbers with nudges — the
# flattery Decision 40 exists to prevent. The marker above is what exempts it,
# read by both gate-instrumentation-check and factory metrics, so the reason
# lives with the gate instead of in a list that drifts. Delete the marker in the
# same commit that makes this a real block.

## What to do

If any of these changes involved a non-obvious fact — a gotcha, a version
mismatch, an API shape, a bug fix that cost time — write it to
memory/lessons/NNN-*.md with provenance (file:line, fetched URL + date, or
"observed YYYY-MM-DD via <action>"). Then delete this file.

See AGENTS.md "Second-brain loop-close" rule.
