# Every file factory-init copies unconditionally must be tracked by git, so a
# clean clone — what an adopter actually installs from — contains it. A file
# present in the working tree but gitignored or untracked passes every local
# test and then aborts the installer's `cp` in a fresh clone. This is
# Decision 6's git-tracking rule, extended from the hooks to the whole install
# manifest, because the same class bit twice.
#
# Scans the repo given as $1, or this repo. Skips when there is no factory-init
# (an adopter repo doesn't ship the installer).
# Exit 0 = every unconditional copy target is tracked (or skip), 1 = one is not.
