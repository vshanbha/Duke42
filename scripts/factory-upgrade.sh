# scripts/factory-upgrade.sh (Decision 16)
# Framework-only upgrade. Re-fetches the template and copies the byte-identical
# framework files — hooks, scripts, the factory dispatcher, factory-doctor,
# .githooks, and the framework docs — over this repo. Thanks to Decision 2 the
# hooks carry no placeholders, so upgrading them is a clean copy.
#
# It NEVER touches your factory.yaml, your content (wiki/ pages, memory/lessons,
# specs, docs/DECISION_LOG.md), or your identity/customizable files
# (opencode.json, the agent prompts, AGENTS.md, README, CODEOWNERS, Makefile).
# Those it only *reports*, so you can reconcile upstream changes yourself.
# Everything lands as an uncommitted diff for you to review.
#
# Usage: factory upgrade [--ref <tag>] [--source <dir>]
#   --ref <tag>     template ref to upgrade to (default: $FACTORY_REF or main)
#   --source <dir>  use an existing template checkout instead of fetching
